statically in the js file.

----Refactor variables. Remove all globals. Double-check where out-of value comes from ---


Remember for final: enable display: none on question, score,message,gameTable. And reverse on image

Add flowchart
Validate code
Create readme

add back to css
#gameTable {
    /* display: none; hidden by default. Will be revealed at game start */
  }

  // turnOnHidden(); //show the hidden elements. Turn on when everything else is ready



  The completed questions array is global. See if it can be somewhat easily be scoped to local
  Refactor other global variables (not many)
  

  Check why the "all to green" is not working
