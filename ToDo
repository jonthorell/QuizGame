The create-question part could be better. It would be far better to get the data from a database or csv-file, but that is for the future. As it is they are stored 
statically in the js file.

Remember for final: enable display: none on question, score,message,gameTable. And reverse on image

add back to css
#gameTable {
    /* display: none; hidden by default. Will be revealed at game start */
  }

  // turnOnHidden(); //show the hidden elements. Turn on when everything else is ready

  CHange table to ordinary buttons to improve responsiveness

  The completed questions array is global. See if it can be somewhat easily be scoped to local

  Random status messages (say 6 different "great job" and 6 "you can do better")

  Check why the "all to green" is not working

 CHeck and  Fix scoring

  Add some styling to the "you answerd" resoponse.

  Add loop
